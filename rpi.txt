+ The output of the GPIO is only able to provide a current of up to 16mA
+ Giving an input that is above 3.3V, or drawing too much current from an output, can permanently damage the Raspberry Pi.  
+ The maximum current that can be drawn from an individual Raspberry Pi GPIO port is  around 16mA. 

+ In September 2012,  the revision 2 boards were released and they changed some of the pin allocations. 

+ To check which version of Raspberry Pi you have, you can run this command:
cat /proc/cpuinfo 
The revision numbers are shown as hexadecimal values. These are 0002 and 0003 for Raspberry 
Pi model B revision 1; 0004 to 000f for Raspberry Pi model A and B; 0010, 0012, and 0013 for A+ and B+; and 
a01041 and upward for Raspberry Pi 2. 

+ The pull-up resistors can be enabled using the broadcast message
config<GPIOport>inpullupand 
inserting the appropriate GPIO port number.  

+  Pull-up resistors   are used to create a high signal where the input value is unknown which is the case if 
there is no signal from a sensor. For example in the case of a simple switch then we can detect when 
the switch is pressed as that gives a clear signal, but when it is not pressed then electrical noise can 
trick the circuit into thinking it is pressed when it is not. When the switch is not pressed then the pull-up 
resistor allows a small current to flow through it which gives a positive voltage (logic high). When the 
switch is pressed then the bottom of the pull-up resistor is connected through the switch to ground. This 
overrides the high signal by effectively connecting the input to ground.

+	Sensors are transducers. So if someone asks you how a sensor exerts control over a circuit’s simply reply, “Transduction!”
 transductio		 →  	transdukcia, prevod, prevedenie, priebeh 
 
 +	typically black is used for wires connected directly to a ground terminal (0 V, GND) and  red  is  used  for  direct  connections  to  a  positive  terminal  (+5  V). 
 
 +	The connection using the two resistors is called avoltage divider.
 
 +	Internal pull-up resistor; enable it with pinMode(pin, INPUT) fol- lowed by digitalWrite(pin, HIGH) or just pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP)
 
 +	There is a built-in pull-up resistor on pins GPIO 2 and GPIO 3. The internal pull-up connects the pin to +3.3 V through a 1800 Ŷ (1.8 k Ŷ ) resistor.
 The pull-up resistor is always connected on these pins. When the button is not pressed, the pull-up resistor pulls GPIO 3 to HIGH, +3.3 V
 
 +	50% * 5V = 2.5 V 
This is well above the minimum level for a HIGH signal, which is about half of
the nominal 3.3 V HIGH level, 1.65 V. Because 1.65 V < 2.5 V, Raspberry con-
siders 2.5 V HIGH.

 +	Because Arduino  pulseIn() returns the pulse length in microseconds (1 μs = 0.001 ms = 1e-6 s), the formula could be modified to use microseconds
 A = 8 * ( tHIGH/(10*1000) - 0.5)
 1 μs = 0.001 ms = 0.000001 s = 1e-6 s
 The unit of A is then g, which equals 9.81 m/s^2
 
 +	Accelerometer and Gyro Together
- When an accelerometer is not moving, it detects gravity and can tell where down is
- A gyroscope can tell the orientation reliably, even if you spin it around and around. A gyroscope ignores gravity, though.

Swap the two bytes in parameter value. MPU 6050 isbig endian. Arduino islittle endianlike most processors. 
The endianness must be converted between the platforms. SeeEndianness—Typically on the Small Sidefor more details
